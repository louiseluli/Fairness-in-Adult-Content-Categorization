**Answer**: The data reveals significant representational biases and harmful stereotyping.
- **Representational Disparity**: `Black x Female` is the most common race/gender intersection, representing **{bw_representation['Percentage'].values[0]:.2f}%** of the corpus, suggesting systemic focus or fetishization.
- **Stereotypical Association**: PMI analysis identified **"{top_pmi_term['Term']}"** as the term most uniquely associated with Black women (PMI Score: **{top_pmi_term['PMI']:.2f}**).
- **Harmful Language**: The `{harm_max_group_tuple[0]}` group had the highest prevalence of terms from the `{harm_max_group_tuple[1]}` category, appearing in **{harm_max_value:.2f}%** of their videos."""

    rq2_answer = f"""### RQ2: Can ML models accurately predict video categories, and do they exhibit any biases?
**Answer**: Yes, models can accurately predict categories but exhibit clear biases.
- **High Accuracy**: The Random Forest achieved **{rf_accuracy*100:.1f}%** accuracy (binary task), and DistilBERT achieved **{bert_accuracy*100:.1f}%** (10-class task).
- **Algorithmic Bias**: The baseline RF was **{rf_accuracy_disparity*100:.1f}% less accurate** for the `race_ethnicity_black` group compared to the `race_ethnicity_white` group."""

    rq3_answer = f"""### RQ3: How can we quantify and compare biases in different classification systems?
**Answer**: Biases are quantified using a suite of fairness metrics (e.g., Accuracy Disparity, Equal Opportunity Difference). By applying these to each model, we created a **Mitigation Effectiveness Comparison Table** that provides a standardized framework to directly compare the fairness-accuracy trade-offs of different systems."""

    rq4_answer = f"""### RQ4: What bias mitigation techniques are most effective?
**Answer**: Effectiveness depends on the desired fairness-accuracy trade-off.
- **Best Balanced Approach**: **Reweighing (Pre-processing)** cut the Accuracy Disparity in half (to **{best_balanced_model['Accuracy Disparity (vs. White)'].values[0]:.3f}**) while maintaining high accuracy (**{best_balanced_model['Overall Accuracy'].values[0]*100:.1f}%**).
- **Most Effective for Fairness**: **Post-processing (Thresholding)** perfectly eliminated the Equal Opportunity Difference (to **{best_fairness_model['Equal Opportunity Diff (vs. White)'].values[0]:.3f}**) at a greater cost to accuracy (**{best_fairness_model['Overall Accuracy'].values[0]*100:.1f}%**).
- **Least Effective**: **In-processing (Exponentiated Gradient)** was ineffective, catastrophically reducing accuracy to 18%."""

    rq5_answer = f"""### RQ5: What are the ethical considerations and potential societal impacts?
**Answer**: The findings point to significant ethical issues.
- **Perpetuation of Stereotypes**: The over-representation of Black women and their association with specific terms indicates that algorithmic systems can amplify harmful **Representational Harms**.
- **Economic Disadvantage**: Statistically significant lower ratings for content with Asian women suggest potential for **Allocative Harm**, which can lead to economic disadvantages on platforms where ratings influence visibility.
- **The Illusion of Objectivity**: High overall model accuracy can mask significant biases against minority groups, highlighting the ethical imperative to conduct detailed fairness audits."""

### Project Limitations

Acknowledging the boundaries of this research is crucial for academic integrity.
- **Lexicon Staticity**: The lexica used for identifying protected groups and harmful language are static snapshots. They may not capture new slang, coded language, or evolving terminology.
- **Correlation, Not Causation**: This study is observational and identifies strong correlations between group identity and outcomes (e.g., lower ratings for Asian women). A formal causal claim would require experimental methods beyond the scope of this dissertation.
- **Simplified Target Variables**: For many of the fairness evaluations, the complex multi-class categorization problem was binarized (e.g., 'Amateur' vs. 'Not Amateur'). While this is a standard and necessary practice for many fairness metrics, it is a simplification of the full problem.
- **Scope of Mitigation**: The project successfully implemented three major families of bias mitigation. However, this is not an exhaustive list. Other techniques and fairness constraints (e.g., Causal Fairness) exist and could yield different results."""
